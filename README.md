# Customer-Segementation-Analysis

I performed an intensive exploration data analysis with R. programming from Quantium Virtual Internship dataset and I conducted customer segementation analysis.

Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities.

deleted outliners.
* Examine customer data – checked for similar issues in the customer data, looked for nulls 
* Explored the data, created charts and graphs as well as noted any interesting trends and/or insights I found.
